Network module
I: int goToFloor, array, unfulfilled calls, 
O: 

-Create working send and recieve functions
-Implement acknowledgement and resend
-Broadcast to everyone?

Acknowledgements;
Sender:
1. Broadcast message to all peers.
2. Wait for acknowledgments from all peers.
3. If acknowledgments are received from all peers, consider the message delivered. Else, retransmit the message. 

Receiver:
1. Upon receiving a message, the message should be processed and an acknowledgment should be sent.
    - The acknowledgment message should contain information to identify the sender.

Acknowledgment Message:
- Structure:
  - SenderID: ID of the sender.
  - Success: Flag indicating successful receipt of the message.



Elevator logic
I: 
O:

-Implement sending to master which order has been fulfilled



Processing pairs
I: 
O: 
-Implement in elevator fsm, one backup where all elevator states and orders are sent 



Master/slave module(?)
I: 
O: 
-Needs init functionality. Here we can decide ID for elevators manually. 
-functionality for changing between master and slave. 
    -How to check if elevators are disconnected? Use order list message as "im alive" signal, if not recieved in certain time, assume elev is disconnected.
-Implement list for alive elevs?
-Should we have version history/id for order lists?  
-Fleeting master? elevator that recieves order calculates optimal elevator to complete order and distributes. All elevator states known by all elevators


Button lights
-Only turn on after master has distributed order list and recieved ack
